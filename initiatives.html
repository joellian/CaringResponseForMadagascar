				</br><h4 style="margin-left:5%;">Literacy</h4>
				<p style="margin-left:5%;">Literacy training has always been at the forefront of CRMF support in Madagascar. CRMF started with funding for one literacy center in 2002 and offered the first adult literacy program for the poor in the Tamatave region.
				Literacy classes expanded based on high demand, and we have funded more than 20 centers, including school supplies, teacher training, and salaries. In some cases, we also paid for electricity or solar lighting. Over 3500 people completed basic literacy instruction through the classes.

				</p>		
				<h6 style="margin-left:5%;">Computer Training</h6>	
					<p style="margin-left:5%;">
						
Technology skills are critical for the future. CRMF-funded computer centers are so popular that there are waiting lists for classes. One young man spoke about his experience at a literacy event. He was employed at a bank, yet his opportunities for promotion and earnings were limited due to his lack of computer skills. Traditional training programs were unaffordable. After classes at one of the technology centers, he was able to increase his salary and move into a better position.
					</p>
				
				<h6 style="margin-left:5%;">World Literacy Day</h6>	
					<p style="margin-left:5%;">Every September, past and present literacy program students and staff gather to help celebrate World Literacy Day. For the 2009 celebration, ONG St. Gabriel and CRMF chose a poor, urban area in Toamasina near a well-established center as the site for the events. Some shared stories about the impact of literacy in their lives, while others participated in competitions to develop songs and cultural dances. The event was covered by the local media and both traditional and computer literacy centers experienced an increase in interest in the following days.

				</br><h4>Healthcare</h4>
				<p>For both urban and rural poor in Madagascar, affordable medical treatment is limited or often nonexistent. In past years, CRMF has funded supplies, training, and free treatment from rural medical clinics, to prison hospitals, to urban medical centers. Our goal has been to provide medicine and supplies for the patients who we treat, as well as provide training for local healthcare providers on how to perform simple, yet life-saving procedures. This enables to healthcare workers to better serve their communities, as well as train additional professionals.</p>
				
				<h6>2011</h6><p> The CRMF medical outreach team partnered with the Ankirihiry CSB2 clinic in urban Toamasina. Dr. Egner saw that postpartum hemmorage, hypertension, and post-delivery infection were areas of great risk for new mothers. The CRMF-funded plan had multiple components.
				</p>
				<h6>2012:</h6>
				<p>

					CRMF began funding the Helping babies Breathe program – an internationally recognized program focuses on newborn resucitation. Dr. Egner conducted training classes for local doctors, nurses, and mid-wives to enable them to save lives.
					</p>
				<h6>2013</h6><p>

				The Ministry of Health requested that the training program be expanded to other regions based upon its success, and the women trained in the past became the teachers.

				New training incorporated critical care issues in pregnancy and recognizing the signs of stress in newborns.
				</p>
				<h6>2014</h6><p>

				Dr. Egner researched, created, and taught local practitioners to create a simple device to reduce postpartum hemorrage .

				All patients in the delivery ward received iron and vitamins to help combat malnutrition.

				</br><h4>Healthy Villages</h4>
				<p>One of the greatest challenges in the rural areas of Madagascar is sanitation. Many villages lack sanitary latrines, potable water, water filters, and basic hygiene education. As a result, waterborne diseases account for more than 10% of the nation’s yearly death toll, and diarrheal illnesses are a major cause of death for children under five. Challenges include:</p>
				<h6>1. Hygiene education</h6>
				<p>This was achieved using the internationally recognized Community Led Total Sanitation program (CLTS.) This model requires that the village leaders endorse the program, and that everyone in the village participates and becomes a health advocate.</p>
				<h6>2. Sanitary Latrines</h6>
				<p>Each family in the village helps build their own sanitary latrine. For every latrine, deep holes are dug in the ground and lined with cement. They create a composting system that is hygienic, and prevents flies and unpleasant odors.</p>
				<h6>Home Water Filters</h6>
				<p>3. Prior to the projects, the river was the source of drinking water for the village. Now there is a gravitational water system. Also, each family has their own water filtering system, a simple construction of plastic buckets and porcelain candles.</p>
				</br><h6>Nutrition</h6>
				<p>The SEEDS project is one component in our integrated approach to combat hunger and malnourishment. In 2010, through a grant from The Watson Foundation, CRMF was able to help a thousand families and thirty schools benefit from the donation of thousands of packets of fruit and vegetables seeds. Seed distribution took place through the CRMF literacy centers. Before the seeds were distributed, however, literacy

students received lessons in home gardening. There were classes and practice in how to plant seeds, thin and care for the seedlings, and maintain a garden successfully. An agricultural specialist taught the students to identify insects that could harm the growing fruits and vegetables and students also learned about good nutrition and the value of incorporating fruits and vegetables into the family diet. The gardens growing today were started with seeds from last year’s plants.</p>
				<p>This Mushroom Garden, sponsored by the BVM Hunger Fund involves the development of nutritious mushrooms that can be locally grown and harvested. Like the SEEDS project, this program promotes learning and self sufficiency among the poor by offering them much needed training in the cultivation of nutritious options for feeding their families and for generating income. An agricultural technician from India came to Toamasina to assist in testing and growing mushroom spawn, and participants were trained to sow the seeds and cultivate the full grown mushrooms. Once training is complete, the literacy students can take their new learning home with them and grow mushrooms in their rural villages. Interest in the project was so great that the local Ministry of Agriculture has expressed interest in learning more about this project.</p>

				</br><h4>Disaster Relief</h4>
				<p>In early January of 2018, Madagascar took direct hits from multiple cyclones. The result was widespread devastation, including damage to the offices of ONG St Gabriel. The storms also destroyed some of the newly-constructed outhouses, stove chimneys, and water filters in Antetezambaro, where CRMF is teaming up with ONG St. Gabriel to equip 2,000 residents with clean water and sanitation. </p>
				<p>When the plague struck the village of Antetezambaro, as part of a national epidemic, immediate funding from CRMF enabled our partner organization, ONG St. Gabriel, to move quickly to save lives.  The national epidemic included both bubonic and pneumonic plague, infected over 800 people and, took more than seventy lives. It was most severe in the Toamasina area where Antetezambaro is located.</p>
				<p>Model Healthy Village project director Mlle. Jeannette Nirina organized a campaign to reach all 350 households in the village. Families were educated on early warning signs of the disease and methods of prevention. Then the ONG St. Gabriel teams led the community in a five-day campaign that included clean-up of public areas, private homes, garbage collection and garbage disposal. Homes and communal areas were sprayed with insecticide to wipe out fleas that cause the disease and, because the fleas live on rats, the distribution of rat poison. Finally, because the pneumatic form of the plague is highly contagious, every member of every household has received gloves and masks. We are so grateful for the efforts of our partners who put themselves at risk to protect the lives of the poor.				</p>
				<h6>Cyclone Giovanna</h6>
				<p>In February, 2012, the Tamatave region received a direct hit from Cyclone Giovanna. Thousands lost their homes, businesses, and local schools in the storm and flooding that followed. Many CRMF families lost the gardens that served as both food for their family and as a source of income. Disease then followed, with devastating results. Among those who lost their lives was an entrepreneur in the microlending program and mother of seven children. Thanks to an emergency grant, CRMF was able to assist ONG St. Gabriel in providing continuous access to clean water and sanitation.</p>
				<h6>Foulepoint Fire</h6>
				<p>When a cooking fire lead to the destruction of 80% of this small town, CRMF provided immediate relief in terms of clothing and cookware.</p>
				<h6>Emergency Nutritional Support (2005)</h6>
				<p>When local officials raised a concern about growing malnutrition amongst children, CRMF helped by stocking rural shops with vitamin enriched food packets. Mothers received instructions on preparation and a visit from a trained professional.</p>
				<h6>Cyclone Ivan (Spring 2008)</h6>
				<p>With winds of 185 miles per hour, this storm resulted in loss of life, destruction of homes and excessive flooding. A national state of catastrophe was declared, as thousands of trees and crops were destroyed. Emergency grants provided aid to rebuild fishponds, rice paddies, schools, homes and purchase new seed.</p>
				<h6>Educational Funding (2004)</h6>
				<p>CRMF provided funding to keep rural elementary schools open during country’s financial crisis.</p>
				<h6>Cyclone Kinsey (2002)</h6>
				<p>With winds of 185 miles per hour, this storm resulted in loss of life, destruction of homes and excessive flooding. A national state of catastrophe was declared, as thousands of trees and crops were destroyed. Emergency grants provided aid to rebuild fishponds, rice paddies, schools, homes and purchase new seed.</p>
